Test Plan for E-commerce Company Product Pipeline

1. Input Data Test:
   - Test with a dataset containing no records to ensure graceful handling of empty input.
   - Test with datasets containing invalid columns or missing required fields for error handling.

2. Data Processing Test:
   - Test with datasets containing successful and unsuccessful applications.
   - Verify pipeline processes data, removes rows without names, and calculates the above_18 field accurately.
   - Ensure the pipeline generates membership IDs as per the specified format.

3. Validity Check Test:
   - Test with datasets containing invalid mobile numbers, email addresses, and birthdates for rejection.
   - Test with applicants whose age is less than 18 years for unsuccessful applications.

4. Batching and Scheduling Test:
   - Schedule the pipeline to run hourly using cron or Airflow.
   - Test with datasets of varying sizes to ensure correct batching.

5. Summary Notification Test:
   - Verify summary notification contains correct details: rows processed, successful applications, unsuccessful applications, and any additional data quality metrics.

6. Data Organization Test:
   - Check output folder for processed datasets to ensure correct organization and naming.

7. Performance and Scalability Test:
   - Test pipeline performance with large datasets for scalability assessment.
   - Evaluate processing time and resource utilization.

8. Error Handling Test:
   - Introduce errors (e.g., file permission issues) to ensure graceful handling and meaningful error messages.

9. Recovery Test:
   - Simulate pipeline failure and check recovery when run again.

10. Edge Cases Test:
    - Test with boundary cases (e.g., applicants turning 18 on the application date) to verify accuracy.

11. Data Retention Test:
    - Test pipeline behavior with overlapping data or potential duplicates.

12. Long-Running Test:
    - Run the pipeline continuously for an extended period to assess stability.

13. Concurrent Test:
    - Simulate multiple instances running concurrently to ensure no interference.

14. Regression Test:
    - Repeat all previous test cases after making changes to ensure no new issues.

15. Logging and Monitoring Test:
    - Check pipeline logging and set up monitoring for performance tracking.

*Document test cases, expected results, and actual results for each test. 
*Address any issues discovered during testing and retest to ensure resolution.
