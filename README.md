# Project Sections Overview

This project encompasses four key sections, each with its unique focus and requirements:

## Section 1: Data Pipelines

In this section, the project addresses the design and implementation of data pipelines for processing membership applications. Applications are periodically received and processed based on specific criteria, including mobile number validation, age verification, and email validity. Processed datasets must adhere to defined constraints, and additional considerations, such as summary notifications, must be incorporated into the pipeline. The section also outlines the importance of a test plan to ensure the robustness of the design.

## Section 2: Databases (Option 1)

This section outlines the task of creating a database infrastructure for a sales transaction system in an e-commerce company. It focuses on the entity-relationship diagram design to represent the required data models, database deployment using PostgreSQL with Docker, and SQL queries to fulfill specific requirements. The provided link directs to the Docker image for deployment, and the submission includes DDL statements and Docker-related scripts.

## Section 3: System Design

As the Tech Lead, this section requires the preparation of a presentation on redesigning and shifting the existing on-premise infrastructure to the cloud. The focus is on data processing and storage, considering data sources, code migration, data retention policies, Business Intelligence resources, and monitoring. The presentation should address design considerations and assumptions.

## Section 4: What is Data Engineering?

This section involves creating a persuasive presentation to executive leadership about the importance of data engineering in a scenario where data consolidation and reduction of data duplication are key objectives. The use-case can be related to any business function, and the presentation should cover the definition of data engineering, its value, or the concept of a data warehouse in the context of the scenario. The presentation should be concise, considering the audience's senior management background.
